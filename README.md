# AI Saturdays: Reinforcement Learning Track
Code and notes from the AI Saturdays (Madrid, 3rd ed.) Reinforcement Learning Track.


## Session 1 - 2020-02-08
For this first session we had to watch the following lectures from CS 285 at UC Berkeley (Deep Reinforcement Learning):
 * [Lecture 1: Introduction and Course Overview](http://rail.eecs.berkeley.edu/deeprlcourse/static/slides/lec-1.pdf)
 * [Lecture 2: Supervised Learning of Behaviors](http://rail.eecs.berkeley.edu/deeprlcourse/static/slides/lec-2.pdf)
 * [Lecture 4: Introduction to Reinforcement Learning](http://rail.eecs.berkeley.edu/deeprlcourse/static/slides/lec-4.pdf)

We also had to take a general look al [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html), since this would be the DL framework used throughout the course.

During the session we had a look at some basic Reinforcement Learning concepts:
 * Overview of environments, statuses, observations, policies and actions.
 * Commonly used notation
 * Markov chains
 * V and Q functions
 * Model Free and Model Based Reinforcement Learning
 * Imitation Learning

Afterward, we started to code a couple of small examples in [Gym](https://gym.openai.com/).
